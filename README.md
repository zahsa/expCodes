# The effect of top-down attention in occluded object recognition

This study is concerned with the top-down visual processing benefit in the task of occluded object recognition. To this end, a psychophysical experiment is designed and carried out which aimed at investigating the effect of consistency of contextual information on the recognition of objects which are partially occluded. The results demonstrate the facilitative impact of consistent contextual clues on the task of object recognition in presence of occlusion.
